# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-
In the past ten years, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has become important in how people interact with computers and other advanced speech systems. An SER system tries to figure out what emotions someone is feeling by analysing their speech. But there's a big gap between how humans and machines understand and interpret emotions in speech, which makes it hard to combine knowledge from different fields like speech emotion recognition, psychology, and human-computer interaction. This paper reviews recent research on different aspects of SER systems to give readers an up-to-date understanding of this hot research topic. It also points out areas where more research is needed, which could help other researchers, organizations, and regulators focus their efforts.
